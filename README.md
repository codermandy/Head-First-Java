# Head-First-Java Book Exercises and Examples
This contains all the examples used inside the book, examples given between the chapters and examples of the exercies.
I certify myself that they are not copy pasted and done refering to the question without seeing the code.
Disclaimer:After writing code on my own I did checked some codes from book but still I gained knowledge by doing on my own.
I recommend every reader to follow the instruction given at the start of book:
"Do the exerciese." "Type and run the code"
It really helps.
